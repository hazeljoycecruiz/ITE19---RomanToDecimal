# Roman Numeral Calculator

This project is a Roman numeral calculator that supports converting Roman numerals to decimal numbers, performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), and converting the results to words. The program reads Roman numeral expressions from an input file, processes each expression, and writes the result in word format to an output file.

## Features

- Convert Roman numerals to decimal numbers.
- Perform arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `=`) on Roman numerals.
- Convert the result of operations into words (e.g., "Twenty-One").
- Validate Roman numerals and ensure proper format.
- Handle expressions from a file input and output results to a file.

## Requirements

- Code::Blocks
- C compiler

## Usage

### Input Format

The program expects an input file called `Input.txt` with one Roman numeral expression per line. Each expression can contain:

- Two Roman numerals.
- A single operator: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `=`.
- The output will be the result in words.

Example input (`Input.txt`):


### Output Format

The program will output the result to `Output.txt`. The result will be written as the word equivalent of the calculated value.

Example output (`Output.txt`):
